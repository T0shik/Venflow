## About

Venflow is a brand new ORM, written from the ground up to try and provide an alternative to EF-Core and many other ORMs. It allows you to define Models and their relations with each other. Additionally it maps all queries on its own while still maintaining great performance.

Lets face it, EF-Core is awesome, but it can be slow, really slow. However this library tries to overcome that by providing similar features while maintaining great performance. Venflow comes with a very similar UX to Dapper and EF-Core, in order to keep the learning curve as low as possible. 

#### Features

- Simple change-tracking for update operations
- Autogenerated Inserts
- Autogenerated Deletes
- Autogenerated Query Materializer, Join Generator
- SQL Injection safe string Interpolated SQL


### Collaboration

The simplest way to do so, is by giving the project a :star: and sharing the project to others. How you can help other than that? This can be done in numerous ways, over on the issue section, such as:

- Creating feature requests
- Creating pull requests
- Reporting bugs

For more information take a look at our [contribution guideline](https://github.com/TwentyFourMinutes/Venflow/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Installation

Venflow can currently be downloaded on [nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Venflow).

Also you can install it via the **P**ackage **M**anager **C**onsole:

```
Install-Package Venflow
```

## Comparison

Benchmarking ORM's isn't an easy task, since there are a bunch of different factors which can alter the result in one way or another. I do not present any beautiful graphs here simply because they would get too complex and it would require too many graphs to remain practical. This is also the reason why I tried to come up with a composite number based on benchmark results. If you still want check all the individual benchmarks, which you definitely should, the source code can be found [here](./src/Venflow/Venflow.Benchmarks) and the results as `.csv` and `.md` are over [here](./benchmarks).

Lets just directly hop into the composite numbers of each tested ORM.
<!--Benchmark Start-->
| ORM Name | Composite Score\* | Mean Score\* | Allocation Score\* |
| :- | :-: | :-: | :-: |
| #1 [Dapper](https://github.com/StackExchange/Dapper) | 2,917 | 2,813 | 0,104 |
| #2 [Venflow](https://github.com/TwentyFourMinutes/Venflow) | 4,567 | 3,851 | 0,716 |
| #3 [RepoDb](https://github.com/mikependon/RepoDb) | 50,295 | 48,043 | 2,252 |
| #4 [EFCore](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore) | 109,965 | 91,581 | 18,385 |
<!--Benchmark End-->
\* Lower is considered to be better </br>
\*\* Do have missing benchmark entries for specific benchmark groups and therefor might have either better or worse scores.

Now how do I calculate this _magic number_? The formula is as following: 
```
compositeScore = Σ((meanTime / lowestMeanTimeOfGroup - 1) + (allocation / lowestAllocationOfGroup - 1) / 10)
```
A group is considered to be a list of benchmark entries which are inside the same file and have the same count and target framework. Now as some ORM's don't have any benchmarks entries for specific benchmark groups it will instead take the _lowest_ mean and the _lowest_  allocation from this group. The source code of the calculation can be found [here](./src/Venflow/Venflow.Score).

#### Disclaimer

The benchmarks themselves or even the calculation of the composite numbers may not be right and contain bugs. Therefor take these results with a grain of salt. If you find any bugs inside the calculations or in the benchmarks please create an issue and I'll try to fix it ASAP.

## Is this package for you?

Especially for ORM's it is becoming a harder challenge than ever before, to choose the right one for you. This project tries to be as transparent as possible, so if any of the following points apply to you or your project, choose a different ORM at least for your current project.

- You are feeling unsure about writing raw SQL.
- <sup>†</sup> You are using a database other than PostgreSQL.
- <sup>†</sup> You rely on a code-first implementation.
- You require Linq2Sql.

*<sup>†</sup> indicates that this point might change it the future*

#### But why should I use Venflow over EF-Core anyway?

Obviously this project is nowhere near as mature as EF-Core as it already covers all your needs. However Venflow is all about performance in every way. You might ask yourself now, why would I even care? Well, especially for Web-Apps it really matters! Your response times for all requests involving some sort of Database interaction will immediately decrease. This also means that your application will not take up as much resources on your server. Obviously this only is applicable, if the website encounters somewhat high traffic.     

#### But why should I use Venflow over Dapper anyway?

Venflow supports a lot more things out of the box, such as automatically generated Delete/Insert statements, as well as simple change tracking to easily update specific entities. Another big factor, which probably is one of the biggest differences to Dapper, are the automatically generated materializers for queries. A lot of the times a materializer generated by Venflow will be faster, especially for bigger tables, than a hand written Dapper one. This is due to the nature of how Dapper and Venflow handle parsing of SQL results.

## Basic usage

As already mentioned, Venflow tries to keep the learning curve from other ORM's as low as possible, therefore a lot of patterns will seem familiar to either EFCore or Dapper.

### Basic configuration

_The official documentation and guides can be found [here](https://twentyfourminutes.github.io/Venflow/)_

In Venflow you are reflecting your PostgreSQL database with the `Database` class, which will host all of your tables. This class represents a connection to your database and therefor doesn't support multi threaded use. In the following example we will configure a database containing two tables, `Blogs` and `Posts`. One Blog contains many posts and a post contains a single Blog.

```cs
public class BlogDatabase : Database
{
    public Table<Blog> Blogs { get; set; }
    public Table<Post> Posts { get; set; }

    public BlogDatabase() : base("Your connection string.")
    {
    }
}
```

Now lets configure the actual relation between Blogs and Posts through the `EntityConfiguration<T>` class. In the `Configure` , method you can configure several things such as the name of the table this entity should map to and much more. These configuration classes do automatically get discovered, if they are in the same assembly as the `Database` class. If they are not in the same assembly, you can override the `Configure` method in the `Database` class which passes in a `DatabaseOptionsBuilder`, which will allow you to specify assemblies which should also be searched for entity configurations.

```cs
public class BlogConfiguration : EntityConfiguration<Blog>
{
    protected override void Configure(IEntityBuilder<Blog> entityBuilder)
    {
        entityBuilder.HasMany(b => b.Posts)
                     .WithOne(p => p.Blog)
                     .UsingForeignKey(p => p.PostId);
    }
}
```

An instance of your `Database` class exposes the underlying connection and the actual CRUD builders. In the example below you can see how you would query a set of Blogs with their posts.

```cs
await using var database = new BlogDatabase(); // You should register a Transient/Scoped your DI Container.

const string sql = @"SELECT * FROM ""Blogs"" JOIN ""Posts"" ON ""Posts"".""BlogId"" = ""Blogs"".""Id""";

// You can re-use this in different BlogDatabase instances through the database.Blogs.QueryAsync() method
// If you intend to reuse the query below you need to pass the QueryBatch method false for the disposeCommand,
// otherwise the underyling command will be disposed after the first use.
var blogs = database.Blogs.QueryBatch(sql).JoinWith(x => x.Posts).QueryAsync();
```

Subsequent joins can be configured using the `ThenWith` method. Do note, that one handy feature of Venflow is string interpolated SQL. This means that most of the methods which accept SQL also have a sibling named `*Interpolated*` which will automatically extract the used variables and use a parameterized query instead.

## Road map

- Composed PK support
- Direct support for many to many relations
- Support for materialized Views
- Bulk operation support from [`PostgreSQL.Bulk`](https://github.com/TwentyFourMinutes/PostgreSQL.Bulk)
- Code-First
- AOT proxy/entity generation with Source Generators
